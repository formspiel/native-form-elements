# Native Form Fields
The site nativeformelements.com is a great source to learn about the behaviour of native form fields. Unfortunately a lot of details are missing. This is proposal to update.

The page is a grid with the states of the all available input fields.

## Design
The default of the page is without any design. Just a few basics for light &amp; dark mode as well as hight contrast mode.

## ToDo
* design https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Styling_web_forms
* integrating a form design system like https://purecss.io/forms/
